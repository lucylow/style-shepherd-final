/**
 * Return Risk Prediction Service (Server-side)
 * Predicts probability of product return using 55+ behavioral, product, and transactional features
 * 
 * NOTE: This file imports from the frontend lib which is outside the server rootDir.
 * In production, duplicate the service code in the server directory for proper separation.
 * For now, this import is commented out to avoid TypeScript compilation errors.
 */

// Re-export types and service from frontend lib
// In production, you might want to duplicate this code in the server for better separation
// export * from '../../../src/lib/returnRiskPrediction.js';
// export { ReturnRiskPredictionService } from '../../../src/lib/returnRiskPrediction.js';

// Temporary placeholder - import from a server-local copy if needed
// The actual service should be copied to server/src/lib/returnRiskPrediction.ts
